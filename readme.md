# Arbitra

bit gay

## How to run

I haven't built it yet, so just download it, use `npm start` to download the packages, then use the following command:

```cmd
.\node_modules\.bin\electron .
```

The application is under construction, so it doesn't actually do anything (yet)

## Features

- Sending messages
- Mining arbitrary units
- Viewing the blockchain

## Why?

This is for a Computer Science A-level Non-Examined Assessment. As such, it's focus is on implementing algorithms rather than making an actually useful cryptocurrency. Please do not invest your life savings into this.
