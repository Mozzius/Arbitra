# Arbitra

a cryptocurrency

## How to run

I haven't built it yet, so just download it, then use:

```cmd
npm install
npm start
```

The application is still in development, so it's quite buggy.

## Features

- Sending messages
- Mining arbitrary units
- Viewing the blockchain

## Why?

This is for a Computer Science A-level Non-Examined Assessment. As such, it's focus is on implementing algorithms rather than making an actually useful cryptocurrency. Please do not invest your life savings into this.
